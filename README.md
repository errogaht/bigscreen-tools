WIP

idea to make some fancy apps to extend bigscreen
telegram bot to watch your friend enters any of public rooms...
telegram bot to see curren public rooms

linux streaming app OBS -> bigscreen

what is working for now:

- login / renew / verify
- get list of public rooms

problems:
- I have exact sequence of requests from Quest 2 to BS API but when I try to make them by myself API returns 500, problems with: 
- "/room/"+roomId
- "/leave_room"
- probably other requests, not tested yet. requests are the same but always 500
